Question 1

Hi Student,

I received your logo concept from your Dopbox ,and it looks great! I would sugget you to start on making 3 to 5 logos in Adobe Illustrator from all your concepts now. I can tell there are som good ideas from your drawing, like the one on the top right like a packge from your photo named Photo Jul 20, 8 31 24 PM, it is simple and means storage. I also think the one on the midel leftside looks like two layers box from  your photo named Photo Jul 20, 8 32 24 PM is a good idea. I can tell you have some details on this logo concept, so I think you should go forward to use Adobe Illustrator making these logo, and then, focus on every details to make your logo better. Hopefully, these suggestions can help you!

Thank you!

Question 2

Hi Student,

I would love to help you to get best answer you need for your personas. First of all, I would suggest you to use Google Form to make your survey because it is very useful free online tool. You can write down your questionas and options in Google Form, and if some questions are very important for your personas, I would suggest you to make these questions as required, you can find the required options on the right bottom corner. Also for this tool, you can get results as soon as people finished it. Second, I would suggest you to cut some questions because if there are too many questions, people would not to submit the survey back to you. You need to make sure who are your target audence first; then you can focus on some specific questions. Last one, I would sugget you to put demographics on the first step of your survey. Let me know if you have other questions!

Thank you!

Question 3

Hi Student,

I think if you can show me your HTML, that would be helpful to slove this problem. I can suggest you to use hide() jQuery for now, here is an example: 

$(".setbutton").on("click", function(){
  $("#sub-nav-set").toggle();
 
  $("#sub-nav-search").hide();
  $("#sub-nav-view").hide();
  $("#sub-nav-new").hide();
});

Thank you!
