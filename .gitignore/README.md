Hi Student,

I would love to help you to get best answer you need for your personas. First of all, I would suggest you to use Google Form to make your survey because it is very useful free online tool. You can write down your questionas and options in Google Form, and if some questions are very important for your personas, I would suggest you to make these questions as required, you can find the required options on the right bottom corner. Also for this tool, you can get results as soon as people finished it. Second, I would suggest you to cut some questions because if there are too many questions, people would not to submit the survey back to you.
